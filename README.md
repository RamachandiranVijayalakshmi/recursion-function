## recursion-function
- tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself ("recurse"). 
- We use the a variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. 
- The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).
##  Sample code to check recursive function value.
```sh
if(a > 0):
    option = a + tri_recursion(a- 1)
    print(option)
  else:
    option = 0
  return option
```

## Recursion Example 


```sh
1
3
6
10
15

```
